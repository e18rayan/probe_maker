# probe_maker
Script that generates probes for enrichment using standard DNA sequences of desired length and overlap.
Based on previous probe makers, it's recommended to pick between 80-120 nt in length. Shorter ones will result in less specific enrichment.
For overlap, it's recommended around 10 nt to ensure no self hybridization.

Only re library needed to run script. May add a way later to export it in FastA file in future.
